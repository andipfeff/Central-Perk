PHOEBE: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",2,1,201

7237,"MONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",2,3,203
7238,RACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?,2,3,203
7239,"CHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",2,3,203

7261,MONICA: Mmmmm.,2,3,203
7262,"RACHEL: Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",2,3,203
7263,"ROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",2,3,203
7264,PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,2,3,203
7265,ROSS: Please tell me you're joking.,2,3,203
7266,"PHOEBE: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",2,3,203
7267,"ROSS: No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",2,3,203
7268,"PHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",2,3,203

Then it’s Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it’s Chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls’ apartment, Joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them, and it’s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it’s wings.
